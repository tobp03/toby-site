Before this project, I worked on isolated sign language recognition for my bachelor’s thesis, which later got published. Then I had an idea. What if I could make an isolated sign language recognition model actually useful?

By itself, isolated sign language recognition is not that practical. It can only recognize one sign at a time.

This led to the idea behind this project. The sign language translation system is built using loops, fixed rules to separate signs, and LLM to refine sentences.
