🧩 Key points

- Converts original features into principal components using linear combinations.
- The first few components capture most of the dataset’s variance.
- Computed using eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.
- Often used before visualisation or training ML models.

Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique that reduces the dimensionality of data while keeping as much variation as possible. It transforms correlated features into new, uncorrelated components ordered by how much variance they explain.
